N-gon meshes are not always the best choice: rendering engines eventually triangulate them, so there's really no benefit in making an overly complicated model to get n-gon meshes
Especially for real-time applications, using n-gons add a computational overhead.

Artifacts: often the introduction of n-gons causes undesired modifications of the surface's topology. We don't want these.

Edge loops are actually a very good instrument for 3D modeling: apply them to all dimensions! Then, you will be able to edit all the intersection points of the edge loops.
Watch out though, this might be a source of artifacts.

Idea: when in the 'edit loops' step, if you can't edit a loop to get improvement, add a loop!.

Idea: when in the 'cover shape' step, if you can't edit cuboids to get improvement, substitute a cuboid with another primitive.
